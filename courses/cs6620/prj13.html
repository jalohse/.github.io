	<h3>Project Stumbling Blocks</h3>
	<br>
	My image does not seem to have any global illumination. When I look at my photon map, it doesn't look like there are
	any blue photons other than on the wall and there are very few red photons.

	<br>
	I also have weird circles aroung my light and on my teapot. I was able to decrease their visibility with more samples,
	but with fewer samples it looks like this:

	<br> I also had trouble with my stack size, but after increasing it to 3 MB I didn't have that problem anymore.

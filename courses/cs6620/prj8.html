	<h1>CS6620 - Ray Tracing for Graphics</h1>
	<h2>Project 8 - Antialiasing.</h2>
	<h3> Results </h3>
	I first started by implementing 4 samples per pixel. This took 13:21 to render.

	This is compared to the following image, with 16 samples per pixel taking 53:48 to render.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	I then implemented adaptive antialiasing, with four samples being the lowest number of samples
	per pixel, followed by 16 samples, and at the most 64 samples. This image took 16:48 to render.

	<br>
	I noticed that this image did not look particularly good. Without changing my thresholds, I
	rendered the below image with 16, 32, and 64 samples. It took 61:58.

	<h3>Project Stumbling Blocks</h3>
	As I added more samples per pixel, I started to notice that there were a bunch of black pixels
	being generated around my left sphere.

		After debugging, I noticed that I never checked to see if my sine was greater than 1 in
		refraction computations. Setting that value to 1 if it was greater than 1 solved the problem.

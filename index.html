                <p>In my senior honors thesis for Ball State University, a brief look into the history of algorithms
                    that have been instrumental throughout the development of three-dimensional images is given. The
                    findings found from creating a custom ray tracer and the differences between rendering times on a
                    laptop versus two different mobile devices are then presented. Lastly, a summary of all of the
                    findings and ideas about how these algorithms can be improved to run more efficiently on mobile
                    devices are offered.

                <h4>Network Coverage with Uncertainty</h4>

                <p> As part of my Computational Topology class, I worked with a partner to develop a tool that would allow
                users to graphically create networks and view the coverage of each node. We added the extra complexity of
                having the exact node locations uncertain. By creating a specified number of possible locations of a sensor,
                we can give the probability of coverage in an area. I worked primarily on the visualization aspects and
                used D3.js to create the graphical display. The tool can be viewed

                A paper for this project has been submitted to the Symposium on Visualization in Data Science at

                <p> Working with a professor from the Ball State theatre department,
                    I worked with a team to to develop a 3 dimensional interactive stage simulation for students.
                    The goal was to allow students to create their own stage layout for A Midsummer Night's Dream.
                    Using WebGL, we loaded in different models and materials created by an animator and then set up the
                    options to move the objects around the stage, adjust lighting, and the ability to remove or target
                    certain objects. The simulator also includes an export option that takes pictures of different
                    views, a list of objects, and lighting information for grading purposes. The simulator can be found

                <p>The Ball State Achievements app is an application that gamifies the college experience and is aimed
                    at achieving higher scholarship and higher retention rates of students.
                    During the summer of 2014 I worked on developing the backend of this application in PHP.
                    I have helped add new features, fix bugs and other errors, and refactor the project to increase
                    readability and decrease repeated code in both the Android and iOS versions. This app was a Mira
                    Award Finalist in 2015.
                    The app is available to all freshman and sophomore students at Ball State University on the <a

                    parts of this application myself, other than the design and initial requirements. This application
                    first grabs all of the students currently working at the Corps from our internal employee directory
                    and stores their information in a SQLite database. Each student is then displayed on the main page,
                    and a staff member can select any number of students, the day, start and end times, and the length
                    of time they desire for a meeting to be. The application then connects to the Google Calendar API to
                    grab all events for the selected users and finds possible times for each student to meet. </p>

                <h4>Potter Plots</h4>

                <p>Developed in my Visualization class at the University of Utah, I used D3.js to create an interactive
                    way for readers of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series to view deaths, spells, word count, and character
                    interactions throughout the series called

                    document describing the entire design process can be found
                    <a href="/dataviscourse-pr-potter-plots/documents/ProcessBook.pdf" class="purpleLink">here</a>. I am
                    planning on continuing to work on this site to encompass more parts of the series, redesign some
                    of the graphs to be more visually appealing and easier to read, and/or make the data more robust
                    even though the course has ended. I feel like this site could be really useful and help readers of
                    the series see trends that I had not noticed before.

                <p>For my last major project at the Digital Corps at Ball State, I became Junior Project Manager for the
                    Digital Corps Scholarship Application. I was tasked with setting up meetings, following major
                    deadlines and creating intermediary deadlines, ensuring every team member was where they needed to
                    be, and making sure the product met our requirements. On top of all of these duties, I also created
                    a PHP backend for the system and helped put together the admin and user interfaces. This application
                    is being used by the Digital Corps to give incoming freshman both a scholarship and a job for the
                    following fall.</p>

                <p> I worked with <a href="http://www.malirisingfdn.org/" class="purpleLink">Mali Rising</a>, a nonprofit organization
                    based in Salt Lake City, to create a game that  would allow donors and school children to understand
                    the daily life of a middle schooler in Africa for my Master's project. As a middle schooler, the
                    player has to complete various chores during the  day, including pumping water from a well and
                    taking care of livestock. I created the game, with  direction from Mali Rising, in Unity and C# with
                    any modeling needs done in Maya. After the game was completed, the game was sent out to more than 70
                    people for user feedback. From this feedback we were able to tweak gameplay for better usability. I
                    am still working on this project to address other pieces of feedback we received. To see the current
                    version of the game, click

                <h4>Ray Tracing</h4>

                <p>To learn more about ray tracing, I took the ray tracing class offered at the University of Utah. We
                    used a framework built by the professor, but the implementation for the ray tracer itself was built
                    throughout the class. By the end of the semester, my C++ ray tracer could render spheres, triangles,
                    and OBJ objects, shadows, reflections, refractions, glossy materials, textures, soft shadows, and
                    depth of field. We implemented BVH space partitioning and antialiasing. We explored Monte
                    Carlo,
                    path tracing, and photon mapping for global illumination techniques. The image above is my final
                    render for the class, inspired by a friend's Instagram post. Most of the models are not mine, but I
                    created the scene and material properties.

                    that have been instrumental throughout the development of three-dimensional images is given. The

                <p> Working with a professor from the Ball State theatre department,
                    I worked with a team to to develop a 3 dimensional interactive stage simulation for students.
                    The goal was to allow students to create their own stage layout for A Midsummer Night's Dream.
                    Using WebGL, we loaded in different models and materials created by an animator and then set up the
                    options to move the objects around the stage, adjust lighting, and the ability to remove or target
                    certain objects. The simulator includes an export option that takes pictures of different
                    views, a list of objects, and lighting information for grading purposes. The simulator can be found

                    Interactive Computer Graphics was a course I took that used OpenGL and C++ to create applications
                    that rendered scenes using rasterization. Throughout the course, I implemented lights, shading,
                    textures, render buffers, environment mapping, reflections, and shadow mapping. For my final
                    project,
                    I implemented parallax mapping. I created a scene and used online textures with generated bump and
                    normal maps. The code for my parallax mapping application can be found

                <p>
                    As an introduction to physics and its usages in computer graphics, I took the course Physics-Based
                    Animation. Lectures focused on simulation models for deformable solids, cloth, and liquids, along
                    with
                    how to implement real-time physical simulations. With a partner, we developed a tool that would load
                    .OBJ models of skin, bones, and muscles and allow for the deformation of the objects within set
                    limits.
                    I primarily focused on the OBJ models and ensuring that they were in the correct format and that the
                    simulator could parse the data easily.

                <p>
                    History of Volume Rendering was offered in the Fall of 2017. It was focused on discussion of papers
                    on volume rendering since its inception and the different techniques that were developed over the
                    years. I implemented 3 different projects for the class, all using OpenGL. The first was a slice
                    based volume renderer and the second was a ray-tracing based volume renderer. For my final project I
                    worked off of the slice based renderer to implement half angle slicing. The image above is from my
                    slice based renderer without illumination, using the Christmas Present data set.

                <p> As part of my Computational Topology class, I worked with a partner to develop a tool that would
                    allow users to graphically create networks and view the coverage of each node. We added the extra
                    complexity of having the exact node locations uncertain. By creating a specified number of possible
                    locations of a sensor, we can give the probability of coverage in an area. I worked primarily on the
                    visualization aspects and used D3.js to create the graphical display. The tool can be viewed

                <p>Using Python and Django, I created a scheduler application for the Digital Corps. I completed all
                    parts of this application myself, other than the design and initial requirements. This application
                    first grabs all of the students currently working at the Corps from our internal employee directory
                    and stores their information in a SQLite database. Each student is then displayed on the main page,
                    and a staff member can select any number of students, the day, start and end times, and the length
                    of time they desire for a meeting to be. The application then connects to the Google Calendar API to
                    grab all events for the selected users and finds possible times for each student to meet. </p>

                <p>For my last major project at the Digital Corps at Ball State, I became Junior Project Manager for the
                    Digital Corps Scholarship Application. I was tasked with setting up meetings, following major
                    deadlines and creating intermediary deadlines, ensuring every team member was where they needed to
                    be, and making sure the product met our requirements. On top of all of these duties, I created
                    a PHP backend for the system and helped put together the admin and user interfaces. This application
                    is being used by the Digital Corps to give incoming freshman both a scholarship and a job for the
                    following fall.</p>

                    representing Animation, Computer Science, Creative Writing, Philosophy, and Telecommunication majors
                    and a faculty advisor to create a mobile game for 4th grade reading level students. Our goals were
                    to encourage children to read more and to give them cultural empathy. To do this, students play as
                    journalist trying to find the most inspirational encounters with monsters throughout the world for
                    their next book. The game uses PlayN to perform on multiple platforms.<a

                    with two other team members, created an application for one of the music professors on campus. The
                    goal of the application was to allow students to play songs from the carillon that is housed in
                    Shafer Tower on campus. I served as the project manager, keeping communication between ourselves and
                    the client constant and making sure we were meeting all of our requirements, and the backend and

                    to create tasks and milestones to remind them that they need to do certain assignments and bring
                    home certain materials. I jumped into the project after a year hiatus to release the app for
                    students to use. I implemented new features, including a edit screen where students could edit their
                    classes, milestones, and materials and set up push notifications to remind students what supplies
                    needed to be brought home. The app will be released to a Muncie Elementary School in a private app
                    store.

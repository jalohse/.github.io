                <h4>Ball State Achievements</h4>

                <p>The Ball State Achievements app is an application that gamifies the college experience and is aimed
                    at achieving higher scholarship and higher retention rates of students.
                    During the summer of 2014 I worked on developing the backend of this application in PHP.
                    I have helped add new features, fix bugs and other errors, and refactor the project to increase
                    readability and decrease repeated code in both the Android and iOS versions. This app is also
                    currently a Mira Award Finalist.
                    The app is available to all freshman and sophomore students at Ball State University on the <a

                <p>The BSU Rec app displays the current number of people present in specific areas of the Ball State
                    Recreation and Wellness Center.
                    In early 2014 I worked with the backend logic to increase the accuracy of the numbers received from
                    the Rec Center.
                    I single-handedly revitalized the aging Android app to account for new Android API’s and add new
                    features for the Digital Corps in the spring of 2015.
                    The app is available on the <a

                <p> Working with a professor from the Ball State theatre department,
                    I worked with a team to to develop a 3 dimensional interactive stage simulation for students.
                    The goal was to allow students to create their own stage layout for A Midsummer Night's Dream.
                    Using WebGL, we loaded in different models and materials created by an animator and then set up the
                    options to move the objects around the stage, adjust lighting, and the ability to remove or target
                    certain objects.
                    The simulator also includes an export option that takes pictures of different views, a list of
                    objects, and lighting information
                    for grading purposes. The simulator can be found <a

                <h4>Exceptional Me</h4>

                <p>Exceptional Me was an app that was created with the help of an immersive learning class that was
                    targeted to help twice-exceptional students keep track of their school work.
                    The app allows students to create tasks and milestones to remind them that they need to do certain
                    assignments and bring home certain materials.
                    I jumped into the project after a year hiatus to release the app for students to use.
                    I implemented new features, including a edit screen where students could edit their classes,
                    milestones, and materials and set up push notifications to remind students what supplies needed to
                    be brought home.
                    The app will be released to a Muncie Elementary School in a private app store.

                <p>The Ball State Map App allows students to find buildings, services, and directions to different
                    buildings on campus.
                    Starting at the beginning of the summer 2015, I worked on fixing bugs that had persisted in the app
                    since the last release and updating the app to run on iOS 8.
                    Once finished I worked with team members to complete a redesign of the previous app adding new
                    functionality.
                    The app was released for beginning of the Fall 2015 semester and is available on the <a

                    professors at Ball State.
                    I created a graphical user interface to simulate the proposed distributed approach that would

                    I provided assistance in developing a scripting tool for the game in PHP, but mostly worked on the
                    Android based game.
                    I helped implement sound, saving and restoring of the game, and implemented cut scenes. The game was

                <p>Using C# and ASP .NET MVC 5, a team and myself completed a web application for the first hackathon
                    hosted by the state of Indiana.
                    The goal of the hackathon was to create a website that could be used to quickly and efficiently
                    register those in affected and keep track of all of the services needed by the Department of
                    Homeland Security.
                    I primarily set up the backend of the project, though I helped with frontend development as well.
